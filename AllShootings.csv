A plea agreement was reached where Issaman plead guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated battery in a public way & was sentenced to five years in prison.Having already served three & three quarters years of his sentence and given credit for displaying good behavior he is expected to be released soon.He also is required to pay Brian Mulder 3,600 dollars in restitution.","?","Handgun","","","Gunfire resonated outside a residence hall on the NUI campus at 4am in a  dispute involving two NIU students.
