As described, in Our County Paper out of Pacific, Missouri on February 21st, 1883 accidently hit the trigger firing one shot that injured three people. The bullet struck five year old student Mamie Shipley's right arm. The projectile then grazed ""Joy Price's nose, so close that it left a powder mark or burn on her upper lip, and caused the blood to flow from her nose and setting her head awhirling"". The bullet ended it's path by striking Marquis D. Price in his right thigh.

The town's physician, Dr. Cofeman examined the victims and said the event ""was the most miraculous escape from death he had ever seen in his experience"". Dr Cofeman also said ""that the ball had passed so near the bone as to graze it, but he thought it was not fractured at all. Had it deviated a sixth of an inch either way it would have cost the boy his leg if not his life"".
