Potential model:
Let
$$y_i = \text{ length of sentence of the ith school shooting perpetrator}$$
$$r_i = \text{ race of the perpetrator  }$$
$$g_i = \text{ gun used by perpetrator} $$
$$s_i = \text{ type of institution} $$

$$\alpha_j[i] = \text{ random intercept accounting for geographic region}$$

$$Y_i \sim Pois(\lambda_i)$$
$$log(\lambda_i) = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_1*r_i + \beta_2*g_i +  \beta_3*t_i + \beta_4*s_i$$

We will also look at interactions and possible transformations of covariates as needed. 

Questions:  
 - Would a time series component work for this model?  
 - Should institution type be a hierarchical structure?
