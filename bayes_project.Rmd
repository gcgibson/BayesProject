```{r}

```

Potential models:
Let
$$y_i = \text{ length of sentence of the ith school shooting perpetrator}$$
$$r_i = \text{ race of the perpetrator  }$$
$$g_i = \text{ gun used by perpetrator} $$

$$\alpha_j[i] = \text{ random intercept accounting for geographic region}$$
$$Y_i \sim Pois(\lambda_i)$$
$$log(\lambda_i) = \alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_1*r_i + \beta_2*g_i +  \beta_3*t_i$$
